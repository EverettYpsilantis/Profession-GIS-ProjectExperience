# Professional GIS Project Experience - TRC Companies
Geospatial Analysis for Power &amp; Utility, Transportation, and Renewable Energy industries - Through the ArcGIS platform, daily analysis of construction impacts on land use, terrain, wildlife, natural resources, and environmental changes, helping clients make well-informed decisions. 


# Technical Experience Overview
I have been a dedicated member of the TRC Geospatial Solutions and Data Management team since February 2023, and have provided GIS support on projects across the power and utility, transportation, and renewable energy industries. Through contributing to a wide range of TRC services, I have gained proficiency retrieving and presenting spatial data in the ArcGIS Pro software. Each day I collaborate with fellow GIS analysts, Project Managers, and Field Scientists to provide TRCâ€™s clients with environmentally focused engineering solutions. I have extensive experience toward creating visual scope map indexes with a diverse set of data layers for linear route planning. Most recently, I led a flood resilience analysis for Central Maine Power, where I compared FEMA and NOAA sea level rise layers with transmission line assets.
