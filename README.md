# Professional GIS Project Experience - TRC Companies
Geospatial Analysis for Power &amp; Utility, Transportation, and Renewable Energy industries - Through the ArcGIS platform, daily analysis of construction impacts on land use, terrain, wildlife, natural resources, and environmental changes, helping clients make well-informed decisions. 


# Technical Experience Overview
I have been a dedicated member of the TRC Geospatial Solutions and Data Management team since February 2023, and have provided GIS support on projects across the power and utility, transportation, and renewable energy industries. Through contributing to a wide range of TRC services, I have gained proficiency retrieving and presenting spatial data in the ArcGIS Pro software. Each day I collaborate with fellow GIS analysts, Project Managers, and Field Scientists to provide TRC’s clients with environmentally focused engineering solutions. I have extensive experience toward creating visual scope map indexes with a diverse set of data layers for linear route planning. Most recently, I led a flood resilience analysis for Central Maine Power, where I compared FEMA and NOAA sea level rise layers with transmission line assets.


# VISUAL SCOPE INDEXES FOR LINEAR ROUTE ANALYSIS

# Monthly Visual Scope creation for American Electric Power:
Visual scope map indexes are used for environmental impact assessments of transmission line reroutes, structure replacements, or removals
focusing on surrounding landscapes and communities, primarily in the Midwest or Southern United States.

Strip Map Index geoprocessing tool used to create a map series of existing or proposed electric transmission lines compared with hydrological,
property parcels, and geological data layers.
  - Converted AutoCAD files of proposed transmission centerlines and structures into shapefiles to display in ArcGIS Pro.
  - Symbolized structures based on material (steel or wood), by type (tangent, running angle, dead end, & substations), and status (removal or install).
    - Utilized USGS Karst Areas, Hydrographical data such as NWI wetlands, NHD streams, and FEMA Flood Hazard Layers, Rextag pipeline and powerline infrastructure, rail lines and road networks, and local property parcel data.
  - Calculated the total linear feet of the proposed transmission line, and the linear feet of portions intersecting wetland types, geological features, or crossings of surrounding power and gas infrastructure.
  - Each visual scope has an overview title page, orienting the client to the general location of the route.
  - Utilized SQL & Python script within ArcGIS to manipulate labeling, title block formatting, and dynamic text for data driven pages.

# National Grid Resource Mapping:
Presentation of TRC Delineated wetland data alongside proposed National Grid transmission lines for Environmental Resource Figures.

  - Assisted TRC wetland biologists in the field for the Wetland Delineation effort. Helped field crews locate the boundaries of wetlands and waterbodies through soil tests.
  - Plotted the boundary points through a sub-meter GPS – points of hydrography features were then later digitized within ArcGIS pro for analysis and map making.
  - Environmental data is symbolized based on National Grid standards.
  - Timber matting area estimates: resource figures allow the client to visualize the proximity of wetland and stream features to the transmission line to pinpoint areas where timber-matting may be necessary.
    - Timber matting is commonly used in transmission line projects to help stabilize work areas for heavy machinery and protect the ground underneath.
    - Once the locations of matting are picked out, typically overlapping wetlands, for a cost estimate.
- Conducted optimal access road planning for transmission line maintenance:
    - Access line data is provided in kmz., dwg., or shapefile form from the client for cost estimates and environmental impact assessment.
